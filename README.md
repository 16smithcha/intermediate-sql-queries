# Project Summary

In this project, we'll continue to use <a href="http://jxs.me/chinook-web/" target="_blank">Chinook</a> to create more intermediate SQL queries.

## Foreign Keys - New Table

### Summary

When creating tables we can specify a column as having a foreign key. The datatype of our column must match the datatype of the column we are linking to. The most common foriegn key is a primary key which is usually an integer.

### Instructions 

* Create a new table called `Movie` with an `ID`, `Title`, and `MediaTypeId`.
  * Make `MediaTypeId` a foreign key to the `MediaTypeId` column on the `MediaType` table.
* Add a new entry into the `Movie` table with a `Title` and `MediaTypeId`.
* Query the `Movie` table to get your entry.

<summary> <code> Create Movie Table </code> </summary>

```sql
CREATE TABLE Movie (
  ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  Title TEXT,
  MediaTypeId INTEGER, 
  FOREIGN KEY(MediaTypeId) REFERENCES MediaType(MediaTypeId)
);
```

</details>

<details>

<summary> <code> Add Movie </code> </summary>

```sql
INSERT INTO Movie ( Title, MediaTypeId ) VALUES ( "Aladdin", 3 );
```

</details>

<details>

<summary> <code> Query Movie Table </code> </summary>

```sql
SELECT * FROM Movie;
```

</details>

</details>

## Foreign Keys - Existing Table

### Summary

We can also add a foreign key to an existing table. Let's add one to our `Movie` table that references `GenreId` on the `Genre` table.

### Instructions

* Add a new column called `GenreId` that references `GenreId` on the `Genre` table.
* Query the `Movie` table to see your entry.

### Solution

<details>

<summary> <code> Add Foreign Key </code> </summary>

```sql
ALTER TABLE Movie ADD COLUMN GenreId INTEGER REFERENCES Genre(GenreId);
```

</details>

<details>

<summary> <code> Query Movie Table </code> </summary>

```sql
SELECT * FROM Movie;
```

</details>

</details>

## Updating Rows

### Summary

We don't want to leave the `GenreId` equal to `null` so let's add a value using the update command. With an update command you always want to use a `WHERE` clause. If you don't you will overwrite data on all records.

### Instructions

* Update the first entry in the `Movie` table to a `GenreId` of `22`.
* Query the `Movie` table to see your entry.

### Solution

<details>

<summary> <code> SQL Solutions </code> </summary>

<details>

<summary> <code> Updating First Entry </code> </summary>

```sql
UPDATE Movie SET GenreId=22 WHERE id=1;
```

</details>

<details>

<summary> <code> Query Movie Table </code> </summary>

```sql
SELECT * FROM Movie;
```

</details>

</details>

## Using Joins

### Summary

Now that we know how to make foreign keys and change data, let's do some practice queries. The simplest way to use a foreign key is via a join statement. 

### Instructions

* Join the `Artist` and `Album` tables to list out the Artist name and Album name.

### Solution

<details>

<summary> <code> Artist and Album Join </code> </summary>

```sql
SELECT a.title, ar.Name 
FROM Album a 
JOIN Artist ar ON a.ArtistId = ar.ArtistId;
```

</details>

## Using nested queries/sub-selects

The next way to use a primary key is with a nested query/sub-select statement.  By using parenthesis we can do a select inside of a select.  This is really effective when you have a foreign key link between two tables because now we can filter our main query by criteria on a referenced table.

```
select * from Track where GenreId in (select GenreId from Genre where Name='Jazz' OR Name='Blues')
```

We just got all data from Track where the track was pointing to a record in the genre table that happend to be either Jazz or Blues.

The subquery `(select GenreId from Genre where Name='Jazz' OR Name='Blues')` returns an array of GenreId.

Our parent query then checks for Tracks where the Track Genre is in that array `where GenreId in `

## Set a value to null

Sometimes we want to remove values.  Try this then select on the Employee table and look at the first Employee

```
update Employee set Phone=null where EmployeeId=1
```

## Query a null value

Sometimes you want to know when there is no value.  What if wanted to know all customers that purchased for themselves and not a company.   

If you try this what do you see?

```
select * from customer where company = null
```

This, this works: 

```
select * from customer where company is null
```


## Group by

How many albums does each artist have?  We could count manually, but no!  Let's use a group by to do some aggregate counts for us.

Select all artist ids, artist names, and a count of how many albums they have.

```
select ar.artistId, ar.name, count(*) from artist ar join album a on ar.ArtistId=a.ArtistId group by ar.artistId
```

#### challenge
Order this by album count, largest first

## Use Distinct

We have hundreds of customers and want to know which countries our customers come from, but no duplicates!

```
select distinct country from customer
```

## Delete Rows

Always do a select before a delete to make sure you get back exactly what you want and only what you want to delete!

```
select * from customer where fax is not null
```

Then replace the `select *` with a `delete` and you're safely deleting rows.

```
delete from customer where fax is not null
```
